# Knowledge Graphs: A Comprehensive Overview
	- ## Introduction to Knowledge Graphs
	  id:: 67f9a190-b504-46ca-b1d9-cfe1a80f1633
		- Knowledge graphs represent information as a network of entities, relationships, and attributes.
		- They are **essential tools** for organizing *complex* information in a structured way.
		- The term "knowledge graph" gained popularity after Google's announcement in 2012.
		- ### Key Components
			- Nodes (entities)
			- Edges (relationships)
			- Properties (attributes)
			- ==Contextual information== that enriches the data
			- #### Applications of Knowledge Graphs
			- ##### Commercial Applications
			- ###### Specific Use Cases
	- ## Types of Knowledge Graphs

		- ### 1. Enterprise Knowledge Graphs
			- Used within organizations to connect disparate data sources
			- Benefits include:
				- Enhanced search capabilities
				- Improved data integration
				- Better decision making
		- ### 2. Domain-Specific Knowledge Graphs
			- Medical knowledge graphs
			- Financial knowledge graphs
			- Academic knowledge graphs
				- Research-focused
				- Teaching-focused
		- ### 3. Open Knowledge Graphs

		- | Component    | Purpose      | Example                      |
		  | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
		  | Entities     | Basic units  | People, Places, Concepts     |
		  | Relationships| Connections  | "works_at", "located_in"     |
		  | Attributes   | Properties   | Names, Dates, Metrics        |
	- ## Technical Considerations
		- For querying knowledge graphs, you might use SPARQL:
		- ```
		  PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
		  SELECT ?person ?university
		  WHERE {
		  ?person ex:graduatedFrom ?university .
		  ?university ex:locatedIn ex:Germany .
		  }
		  ```
		- Or you might use Cypher for Neo4j:
		- `MATCH (p:Person)-[:GRADUATED_FROM]->(u:University)-[:LOCATED_IN]->(:Country {name: "Germany"}) RETURN p, u`

	- ## Comparing Graph Databases
		- ### Triple Stores vs. Property Graphs
		- Triple stores follow the RDF model (subject, predicate, object)
		- Property graphs allow for ~~richer~~ <u>more flexible</u> relationships
	- ## Challenges in Knowledge Graph Creation
		- Some challenges include:
			- Entity resolution (identifying when two references point to the same entity)
			- Schema mapping (aligning different data models)
			- *Maintaining* data quality
			- **Scaling** to billions of triples
	- ## Knowledge Graphs and Personal Knowledge Management
		- Knowledge graphs like Logseq help individuals organize their thoughts by:
			- Creating bidirectional links between notes
			- Allowing for emergent structure
			- Supporting non-linear thinking
	- ## Future Trends
		- The future of knowledge graphs includes:
			- Integration with Large Language Models
			- Multimodal knowledge representation
			- Decentralized knowledge graphs
			- Self-updating knowledge systems
	- ## Conclusion
		- Knowledge graphs represent a fundamental shift in how we organize and access information. They provide the backbone for many AI systems and will continue to evolve as our understanding of knowledge representation advances.
