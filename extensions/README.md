# Cyberorganism Extensions

This directory contains extensions and modifications to the original AIChat codebase for the Cyberorganism fork.

## Purpose

The extensions folder is designed to keep our changes contained and clearly separated from the original codebase, making it easier to:

1. Identify what has been modified from the original AIChat project
2. Maintain compatibility with upstream changes
3. Document and organize our custom features

## Structure

The extensions directory is organized as follows:

- `README.md` - This documentation file
- (Future subdirectories will be added as needed for specific extension categories)

## Development Guidelines

When adding new features to Cyberorganism:

1. Try to keep changes to the original codebase minimal
2. Place new functionality in this extensions directory when possible
3. Document any changes made to the original codebase
4. Follow the same code style and conventions as the original project
